# Base Simple Contracts

This repository contains minimal smart contract examples built and deployed
on the Base mainnet network.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to demonstrate:
- Smart contract deployment on Base
- Simple state-changing functions
- Onchain interaction using Remix and MetaMask

This repository is intentionally kept simple for learning and experimentation.

## Contracts

### Ping.sol

A basic contract that increments a counter value each time the `ping()` function is called.

### PingV2.sol

An extended version of Ping that adds a reset function to clear the counter.

## Network

- Network: Base Mainnet
- Tooling: Remix IDE, MetaMask

## Notes

These contracts are designed for educational and onchain activity demonstration purposes.

## Future Improvements

- Add events for state changes
- Introduce access control examples
- Demonstrate contract-to-contract interaction
- ## Base Network Note

This repository can be experimented with on Base mainnet
for educational and testing purposes.
